## Multi-Hop Reasoning over a Virtual KB

This repository contains the code for running multi-hop reasoning templates
against a Virtual Knowledge Base (KB). A virtual KB is an index of contextual
representations of entity mentions in text (here Wikipedia). Multi-hop
reasoning is done using a combination of maximum inner product search (MIPS)
over the index, followed by sparse matrix operations. The templates are
used to answer natural language questions from three benchmarks.
